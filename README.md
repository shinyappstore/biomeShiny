# biomeShiny: Visualize microbiome data

#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/biomeShiny](https://shinyappstore.com/a/biomeShiny)__

biomeShiny is a graphical interface for visualizing microbiome data, primarily based around the "phyloseq" and "microbiome" libraries, with the "shiny" library being used to develop the interface. It provides a user-friendly interface to generate and visualize community composition and diversity through interactive plots. Biome-Shiny has a variety of visualizations and tables that can be used to subset and visualize a dataset. Biome-Shiny makes use of phyloseq's .biom importing functions to upload data. It accepts a .biom file as input, and requires metadata (sample_data() in phyloseq format files). This app is a product of BioData.pt, which develops tools to empower researchers and simplify the analysis of data. These tools are Shiny web applications developed in R, and wrap commonly-used analyses in an easy-to-use interface.
